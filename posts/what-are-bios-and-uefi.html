            <h1>What are BIOS and UEFI?</h1>
            <p><em>Published on August 15, 2022</em></p>

            <p><strong>Category:</strong> <a href="../categories/misc.html">Misc</a></p>

            <p>The Basic Input Output System (BIOS) firmware is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to accept
                input and send output to external sources. It is usually a chip located on the motherboard.</p>

            <h2>BIOS in Action</h2>
            <p>Say we have a laptop computer that comes with an external mouse. The BIOS communicates and exchanges data
                with this mouse.</p>
            <p>Another example is during the Power-On Self-Test (POST). If the graphics card fails, BIOS may alert you
                with beep codes or error screens, such as Dell devices emitting 6 beeps for a failed graphics card.</p>

            <h2>UEFI: The Modern Alternative</h2>
            <p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a modern replacement for BIOS. It offers faster boot
                times, supports larger drives, and includes advanced security features like Secure Boot.</p>

            <h2>BIOS Hardening Techniques</h2>
            <h3>1. Flashing</h3>
            <p>Updating BIOS (flashing) can include critical security patches but comes with risks like bricking the
                computer if an error occurs during the update.</p>

            <h3>2. Setting a BIOS Password</h3>
            <p>BIOS allows setting admin passwords to restrict unauthorized access. However, resetting it is often as
                simple as resetting a jumper or cable.</p>

            <h3>3. Enabling Secure Boot</h3>
            <p>Available only in UEFI, Secure Boot prevents malware from running during boot time. Most systems have it
                enabled by default.</p>

            <h3>4. Full-Disk Encryption (FDE)</h3>
            <p>FDE locks down a computer's data with a password, preventing unauthorized access even if the attacker has
                physical control. However, losing the FDE password makes data recovery impossible.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Understanding BIOS and UEFI, along with implementing hardening techniques like Secure Boot and FDE, is
                essential for securing your computer and its data. Keep these concepts in mind as you manage your
                system's firmware!</p>
