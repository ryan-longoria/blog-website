            <h1>Understanding Moore's Law and Its Impact on Computer Architecture</h1>
            <p><em>Published on 2022-05-02</em></p>

            <p><strong>Category:</strong> <a href="../categories/misc.html">Miscellaneous</a></p>

            <p>Created by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, in 1965, Moore’s Law concludes that “the number of
                transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.”</p>

            <h2>Why is this Important?</h2>
            <p>There are some major takeaways from this statement that actually bring the future architecture of
                computers huge benefits.</p>

            <h2>More Transistors = More Functional Units</h2>
            <p>Functional units are pieces of a CPU that run operations instructed by a computer program. Examples of
                functional units are arithmetic logical units and floating-point units. With more functional units, CPUs
                are able to perform more operations, thus, advancing the technology largely.</p>

            <h2>More Transistors = More Cores</h2>
            <p>Basically, the more cores, the better a CPU will perform. Multiple processes are able to run at the same
                time with more cores which increases efficiency by an insane amount. A single-core CPU is much less
                efficient when it comes to running multiple processes.</p>

            <h2>More Transistors = Big Cache</h2>
            <p>Cache memory is what reduces performance bottlenecks between RAM and CPU. Having a big cache will reduce
                these bottlenecks even further. This means that the efficiency and speed of a CPU are heavily increased
                when there is a big cache.</p>

            <h2>More Transistors = More Complex Management Units</h2>
            <p>The complexity of management units is important because it means that they can perform more tasks and
                handle a larger variety of them. There is always the debate on simplicity vs complexity, but if you’re a
                complexity type of person who wants a more efficient system, then this is your ride!</p>

            <p>Moore’s Law also states that the number of transistors doubling is marked to stop in 2025. This is
                because the future of transistors lies in 1nm chips which are smaller, faster, and stronger.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Understanding Moore's Law and its impact on computer architecture is essential for appreciating the rapid
                advancements in computing technology. As we approach the limits of transistor miniaturization, the
                industry continues to innovate, paving the way for more powerful and efficient computing solutions. Stay
                tuned to this blog for more insights into the latest developments in computer science and technology!
